# ARISE Conceptual View (RM-ODP)

## Enterprise, Information, Computational (Conceptual level)

### Mission
Accelerate safe aging‑reversal research by prioritizing interventions before wet‑lab work.

### Stakeholders
Clinicians, bench scientists, IRB, data scientists, investors.

### Core Concepts
- Candidate: {name, type, dose, pulse_hours, target_genes}
- Scores: {Rejuvenation, SafetyRisk, Confidence, Composite, Uncertainty}
- Lineage: {data_version, model_version, parameters, commit_sha}

### Policies & Principles
- Evidence over hype; versioned models and reproducible outputs
- Safety co‑primary with efficacy
- Privacy by design for any patient‑linked data
