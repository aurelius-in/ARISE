# 🧬 ARISE 
### *Aging Reversal In-Silico Evaluation*

**ARISE** is an AI-powered simulation engine that virtually tests and ranks potential aging-reversal therapies.  
It lets researchers and clinicians explore thousands of synthetic interventions using public datasets—no wet lab required—and generates standardized, clinician-ready reports that balance **rejuvenation potential** with **safety confidence**.

---

## 🌍 Vision

ARISE was built to **accelerate and de-risk longevity research** by combining modern AI with reproducible scientific design.

- **Simulate aging reversal safely.** Run millions of in-silico trials across genetic, epigenetic, and molecular candidates.  
- **Prioritize what works.** Rank each therapy by rejuvenation gain, safety risk, and model confidence.  
- **Standardize results.** Generate clinician-friendly reports with traceable data, audit trail, and RM-ODP architecture compliance.  
- **Bridge science and medicine.** Translate computational discovery into validated wet-lab studies faster and more ethically.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/ARISE.git
cd ARISE
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Windows
./run.ps1

# macOS/Linux/WSL
./run.sh

Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
You’ll see the ARISE interface matching the official logo and theme.
## 🔁 5-minute autopush

- Windows: `./dev/autopush.ps1`
- Unix/WSL: `./dev/autopush.sh`

Commits to `develop` every 5 minutes with a succinct message. Type `c` at the prompt to continue another 5 minutes.

🧩 What It Does

1. Loads public datasets (LINCS L1000, Aging Atlas, GEO methylation sets, Open Targets).


2. Runs a simulation pipeline that generates virtual therapies and scores them on:

Rejuvenation (how “younger” cells appear)

Safety Risk (tumorigenic/dedifferentiation likelihood)

Confidence (training-data proximity and stability)



3. Produces a ranked leaderboard of the top candidates.


4. Generates a clinician/research report (PDF + CSV) including:

Ranked candidates

Top biological pathways

Confidence and safety summaries

Suggested minimal wet-lab validation plan

🧾 Ethics & Positioning

ARISE is not a diagnostic or therapeutic system.
It is a research support tool designed to accelerate scientific discovery, improve reproducibility, and reduce unnecessary animal testing.
All results are hypothesis-generating and must be validated in biological systems under proper regulatory oversight.

🧪 Tech Stack

Python 3.11+

Streamlit — interactive UI

scikit-learn / pandas / numpy — analytics + modeling

ReportLab — clinician-grade PDF generation

FastAPI (optional) — API endpoints

Docker — reproducible deployment

🏗️ Architecture Principles (RM-ODP Aligned)

Enterprise View: Evidence over hype; safety co-primary with efficacy.

Information View: All data & model versions are tracked and reproducible.

Computational View: Modular services for ingest, simulate, score, report, audit.

Engineering View: Streamlit front-end + Python backend, easy to extend.

Technology View: Open standards, containerized, portable to cloud or HPC.

💡 Why It Matters

Aging research often burns time and resources on trial-and-error.
ARISE provides a fast, transparent filter: narrowing thousands of possible interventions to the few that are most likely to succeed safely—turning hype into evidence.
