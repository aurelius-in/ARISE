# ARISE Executive Brief

ARISE is a virtual aging lab that triages interventions in silico, co-optimizing rejuvenation and safety. It compresses months of wet-lab trial-and-error into a week of credible, reproducible analysis.

What it does
- Screens TF programs, small molecules, and pulse schedules using public and proprietary data
- Scores rejuvenation, safety, and confidence with uncertainty and lineage
- Generates clinician-grade PDF/CSV with rationale and a minimal validation plan

Why it matters
- Faster: shortlist in days, not months
- Safer: safety is co-primary; flags and thresholds are explicit
- Trustworthy: RM-ODP architecture, versioned data/models, audit-ready outputs

How to start
- Demo now with public datasets
- Pilot in ~2 weeks on your assays; measure hit-rate uplift and time-to-shortlist

Ethics
ARISE is not medical advice. Treat results as hypotheses to validate under proper oversight.
