# ARISE One-Pager

## The Problem
Aging-drug discovery is slow, expensive, and risky. Teams explore huge search spaces with limited lab bandwidth—burning cycles on low-probability shots.

## The Solution
ARISE is a virtual aging lab that triages interventions in silico. It screens TF programs, small molecules, and pulse schedules using public/proprietary data, co-optimizing rejuvenation and safety.

## What You Get
- Ranked shortlist with rejuvenation, safety, confidence, and uncertainty
- Clinician-ready PDF + CSV with rationale and minimal validation plan
- Evidence trail: data/model versions, parameters, commit SHA

## Why Believe
- Built on LINCS L1000, Aging Atlas, GEO methylation, Open Targets
- RM-ODP architecture; reproducible, auditable outputs
- Clear uncertainty and safety flags; no black-box hype

## ROI
- 5–10x faster time-to-shortlist
- 2–3x higher hit rate vs lab-as-usual (pilot targets)
- Reduced wasted assays, clearer go/no-go calls

## Pilot in 2 Weeks
- Week 1: Align endpoints, import datasets, calibrate scorers
- Week 2: Run triage, deliver PDF/CSV, finalize validation plan

## Call to Action
Start with the demo report today. Bring your datasets next week. Compare ARISE triage vs current process—decide on evidence, not hype.
